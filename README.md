# Arona: autonomous AI waifu & assistant

Arona is an autonomous, data-oriented AI personal assistant powered by TypeScript and Rust. Runs in both the browser, CLI, and programmatically via API.

### Usage

- Use the browser interface via https://arona.poom.dev
- Serve locally via `arona serve`

### Installation

`npm i -g arona`

### Features

- **language model integration**: uses LLMs (e.g. OpenAI GPT-4, LaMDa, LLaMA) to generate responses.
- **task-driven autonomous agent**: given a single starting objective, Arona can generate a sequence of actions to achieve it and execute it.
- **voice input**: uses OpenAI's Whisper model to accept voice inputs
- **communication with multiple agents**: multiple agent instances can communicate with other agents.
- **external actions**: Arona can interact with the outside world by executing actions, e.g. search on Google, send an email, etc.
- **time travelling and debugging**: as Arona prompts and actions are logged as pure JSON objects, time-travelling and branching is possible.
- **data source insights**: you can supply data sources that Arona can look into (e.g. SQL databases)

### How does it work?

- Produce the sequence of actions based on the initial objectives.
